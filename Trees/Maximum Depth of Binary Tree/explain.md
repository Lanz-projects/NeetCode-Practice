## 🧩 Approaches Considered

### 1. Brute Force (if applicable)

- One or two bullets describing how it works
- Why it’s too slow or not ideal

### 2. Optimal Approach

- The strategy you chose
- Why it works
- Why it’s better than brute force

## 🧪 Final Code (Python)

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution(object):
    def maxDepth(self, root):
      if not root:
        return 0
      else:
        return 1 + max(self.maxDepth(root.left), self.maxDepth(root.right))
```
