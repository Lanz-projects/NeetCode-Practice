## 🧪 Final Code (Python)

```python
class Solution(object):
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas, cost):
        """
        :type gas: List[int]
        :type cost: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if sum(gas) < sum(cost):
            return -1

        res = 0
        total = 0
        for i in range(len(gas)):
            total += gas[i] - cost[i]
            if total < 0:
                total = 0
                res = i + 1
        return res
```
